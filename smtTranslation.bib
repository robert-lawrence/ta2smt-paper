    abstract = {Timed Automata (TA) is de facto a standard modelling formalism to represent systems when the interest is the analysis of their behaviour as time progresses. This modelling formalism is mostly used for checking whether the behaviours of a system satisfy a set of properties of interest. Even if efficient model-checkers for Timed Automata exist, these tools are not easily configurable. First, they are not designed to easily allow adding new Timed Automata constructs, such as new synchronization mechanisms or communication procedures, but they assume a fixed set of Timed Automata constructs. Second, they usually do not support the Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and rely on a precise semantics for the logic in which the property of interest is specified, which cannot be easily modified and customized. Finally, they do not easily allow using different solvers that may speed up verification in different contexts.This article presents a novel technique to perform model checking of Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) properties on TA. The technique relies on the translation of both the TA and the MITL formula into an intermediate Constraint LTL over clocks (CLTLoc) formula, which is verified through an available decision procedure. The technique is flexible, since the intermediate logic allows the encoding of new semantics as well as new TA constructs, by just adding new CLTLoc formulae. Furthermore, our technique is not bound to a specific solver as the intermediate CLTLoc formula can be verified using different procedures.},

abstract="Symbolic Model Checking [3], [14] has proven to be a powerful technique for the verification of reactive systems. BDDs [2] have traditionally been used as a symbolic representation of the system. In this paper we show how boolean decision procedures, like St{\aa}lmarck's Method [16] or the Davis {\&} Putnam Procedure [7], can replace BDDs. This new technique avoids the space blow up of BDDs, generates counterexamples much faster, and sometimes speeds up the verification. In addition, it produces counterexamples of minimal length. We introduce a bounded model checking procedure for LTL which reduces model checking to propositional satisfiability.We show that bounded LTL model checking can be done without a tableau construction. We have implemented a model checker BMC, based on bounded model checking, and preliminary results are presented.",

abstract="Timed automata (TAs) are a common formalism for modeling timed systems. Bounded model checking (BMC) is a verification method that searches for runs violating a property using a SAT or SMT solver. Previous SMT-based BMC approaches for TAs search for finite counter-examples and infinite lasso-shaped counter-examples. This paper shows that lasso-based BMC cannot detect counter-examples for some linear time specifications expressed, e.g., with LTL or B{\"u}chi automata. This paper introduces a new SMT-based BMC approach that can find a counter-example to any non-holding B{\"u}chi automaton or LTL specification and also, in theory, prove that a specification holds. Different BMC encodings tailored for the supported features of different SMT solvers are compared experimentally to lasso-based BMC and discretization-based SAT BMC.",

abstract = "We present a satisfiability-preserving reduction from MITL interpreted over finitely-variable continuous behaviors to Constraint LTL over clocks, a variant of CLTL that is decidable, and for which an SMT-based bounded satisfiability checker is available. The result is a new complete and effective decision procedure for MITL. Although decision procedures for MITL already exist, the automata-based techniques they employ appear to be very difficult to realize in practice, and, to the best of our knowledge, no implementation currently exists for them. A prototype tool for MITL based on the encoding presented here has, instead, been implemented and is publicly available."

We use a new automata-theoretic technique to show PSPACE decidability of the logic for the constraint systems (Z,<,=) and (N,<,=). Along the way, we give an automata-theoretic proof of a result of Balbiani and Condotta when the constraint system satisfies the completion property. Our decision procedures extend easily to handle extensions of the logic with past-time operators and constants, as well as an extension of the temporal language itself to monadic second order logic. Finally we show that the logic becomes undecidable when one considers constraint systems that allow a counting mechanism."

abstract="We present an approach for the automated formal verification of distributed systems based on the Storm technology. The approach is based on a formal model of the behavior of Storm topologies given in terms of the CLTLoc metric temporal logic extended with counters. We present a tool-supported mechanism to automatically generate formal models from high-level description of Storm topologies. The Zot formal verification tool is then used to check whether some desired properties hold for the modeled system or not. The analyzed properties concern the growth of the queues of the nodes of the Storm topology. Some experiments performed on example topologies show how the timing features of the modeled system influence the behavior of the queues of the nodes.",
